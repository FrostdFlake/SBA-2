# SBA-2 Project Notes

**Late Submissions**
   - Created a function to check what assignments were handed in late and which student was late.

**Weird Post-Mortem Due Date**
   - Needed to check on the weird post-mortem due date.

**Calculating Student Averages**
   - FINALLY mapped how to get all student averages.

**Curving Grades**
   - Decided to cut the learners some slack with a couple of curves.

**Curves Not Working Independently**
   - Still can't get the curves to work independently.
